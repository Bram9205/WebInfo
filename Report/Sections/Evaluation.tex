\section{Project Conclusion}
Since there are a lot of P2000 notifications, we can create a test data set. 
In this data set we will manually classify the notifications and manually create clusters. 
Furthermore, we are manually going to search news web pages and tweets from twitter.
We will classify those news web pages and tweets from twitter. 
Then we can run the whole project on this data set  and check if the ML tasks will produce the same output.

The IR tasks can be evaluated by running queries on the database. 
Then we will check if those queries give the desired results, by manually checking the data set for those queries.

The eventual code for the whole project can be found \href{https://www.dropbox.com/home/Public/Code_2IMW15_Group_20}{here}.
