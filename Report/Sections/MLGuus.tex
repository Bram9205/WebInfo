\subsubsection*{Motivation and relation to project}
Our project attempts to find relevant news articles for certain P2000 notifications, which are linked to events in a specified neighborhood. To determine the relevancy of news articles, P2000 notifications need to be associated with news articles that are relevant to these notification. It is assumed that a certain amount of preprocessing of notifications and articles is done by other modules of the retrieval system, these processed articles have the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Each notification has a date, a number of labels and possibly a location.
\item Each news article has a date and a number of labels.
\end{enumerate}
Using a modified version of association rule learning, the relations between each group of P2000 notifications and group of news articles can be determined.
