\subsection{Collect news feed}
\textbf{Name:} Guus van Lankveld \indent \textbf{StudentNumber:} 0629468

\subsubsection*{Motivation}
To be able to link certain (groups of) P2000 notifications to news articles. These articles need to be retrieved from a number of sources and filtered for relevant information.

\subsubsection*{Approach}
A (yet to be determined) number of local news websites will be scanned based on a specified date and time and all pages within this timeframe are returned. Which local website is chosen will be based on a specified location. After retrieving the pages, all non-relevant information such as scripts and style information will be removed before returning the article.\\\\
To be able to determine which news site should be accessed based on the input location, the system also needs to extract a city region from a specified geolocation or town name.

\subsubsection*{Evaluation }
Evaluation of this component will be accomplished by manually assessing if both small and large timeframes and location combinations as input will yield a set of news articles and tweets that match them.
